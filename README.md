# INFORCE DATA ENGINEERING TASK

## Task Overview:
Build a simple **ETL pipeline** that extracts data from a CSV file, transforms the data, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. Also write SQL queries to perform specific tasks on the data. Finally, containerize the entire application using Docker.

## Prerequisites
- **Operating system:** This project have been tested **only on a Linux (Ubuntu).**
- **Docker and Docker Compose:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and configured.  

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to the project directory `inforce_de_test_task/`
    ``` bash
    cd inforce_de_test_task
    ```
2. Use the next command to build and run Docker Compose and start the necessary containers:
    ``` bash
    make start
    ```

## Future improvments:
- get rid of print statements and add logging (also for `db.py`)
- use sqlalchemy
- write tests for ETL
